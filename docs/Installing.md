# Installing Iceberg

Iceberg is written in PHP, and you'll need PHP 5.3 or higher for it work properly. Iceberg doesn't install files in your system, so installing is a simple as getting a copy of the files, and then running them through the command line. You can do this through git (recommended, it's simpler when you need to update the files) or simply use GitHub's [download](https://github.com/cyrilmengin/iceberg/archive/dev.zip) feature.

```shell
$ cd /wherever/you/want
$ git clone	git://github.com/cyrilmengin/iceberg.git folder_name
$ cd folder_name
$ chmod +x iceberg
